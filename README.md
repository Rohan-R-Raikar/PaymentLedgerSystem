# PaymentLedgerSystem

PaymentLedgerSystem is a secure, CQRS-based transaction and ledger system designed to process transactions, maintain an immutable ledger, and provide read-optimized reporting and dashboards.

## Architecture
- Microservices
- CQRS (Command / Query separation)
- API Gateway
- Role-Based & Attribute-Based Authorization
- Secure Ledger Design

Payment gateway integrations are intentionally deferred to ensure correctness, security, and auditability of the core system.
